# py-utils
I'm an administrator as i heared that python is very good for doin a system development and i have seen it in so many linux distribution
that most of the applications are written in python i decided to learn python.
I'm a rookie but in my department i manage to do some functional coding according to my needs for automation of some process that i
work with which i would like to share with the others and others help me to grow in python.
